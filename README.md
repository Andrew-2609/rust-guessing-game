# Guessing Game

This is my first ever Rust application. It's very very simple, just a guessing game as you'd generally implement when learning a new programming language.

It uses ferris-say to display important messages with more style.

This project is based on [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) book's example.
